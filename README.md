# EventQueue_Prod

This is my version of Event Queue, which was based on David Baron's Event Bus. My version has the Event Bus become Event Queues so that it keeps track how many button presses occurs and plays it with a cooldown:

 - The Launch event is an event queue.
 - The Shoot event is an event queue.
 - The Talk event is an event queue.
 - The Hide event is an event bus.
